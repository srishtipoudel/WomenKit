                    1. According to a national health survey, nearly 13% of women over the age of 18 are in fair or poor health.
                     While this number seems low, it could be even lower if all women met recommended guidelines for diet and exercise.
                     <br>
                    2.It is totally normal for your periods not to come like clockwork. 
                    More often than not, your period won’t come every 28 days of the dot. Cycles ranging from 21 to 35 days long are all considered ‘regular’.
                    <br>
                    3.Lack of menstrual hygiene can increase a woman’s chances of contracting cervical cancer, 
                    Reproductive Tract Infections, Hepatitis B infection, various types of yeast infections and Urinary Tract Infection, to name a few.
                    <br>
                    4. Check your blood pressure every 2 years if it's normal (lower than 120/80).
                     If it's high, or you're at risk for high blood pressure, you'll need more frequent checks and diabetes screening tests.
                    <br>
                    5.Intense exercise or certain medical conditions can lead to irregular periods. Irregular periods can also occur in people who are:<br>
                    a.	Obese <br>
                    b.	Breastfeeding <br>
                    c.	Perimenopausal <br>
                    d.	stressed <br>
                    <br>
                    6.Don't use soaps or vagina hygiene products-
                    While using vaginal hygiene products everyday is a good idea, using these products during menses can turn things around. Vaginas have their own cleaning mechanism which comes into play during menstrual cycles, and these artificial hygiene products can hamper the natural process leading to infections and growth of bacteria.
                    <br>
                    7. Some free apps that allow you to record your period information on the go. Consider checking out: <br>
                    i.	Glow <br>
                    ii.	Eve <br>
                    iii.Fertility Friend <br>
                    The more you log, the more these apps can tell you about predicted menstruation dates, your fertile window, and more. <br> 
                    <br> <em> When to see a doctor or other healthcare provider
                    Although occasional changes are often tied to stress and other lifestyle factors, consistent irregularity may be a sign of an underlying health condition.</em>
